# Tests

# Variables and assignments

Define two variables with random integer values, show the sum of the two.

        Output of the program:
        5

# Iteration

1. List numbers from 1..10 each number alone on a single line

        Output of the program:
        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10


2. List only odd numbers between 1..10

        Output of the program should be:
        1
        3
        5
        7
        9

3. Write multiplication table for numbers till 10.

        Output of the program should be:
        1x1=1
        1x2=2
        ...
        1x9=9
        2x1=2
        2x2=4
        ...
        2x9=18
        ...
        

# Functions

1. Write a function which identifies if a number (parameter) is odd or even
and print out "odd" or "even" depending on the number.

        > 12
        even
